This project on Nuclear development analysed the nuclear morphology trend from the Zygote stage to the Blastocyst stage in successful and unsuccessful human embryos. Further analysis examined any significant difference in nuclear morphology between successful and unsuccessful embryos at each developmental stage. Nuclear morphology is defined by nuclear size (Average Diameter) and shape (Circularity). Nuclear data was obtained from time-lapse videos following IVF cycles.
